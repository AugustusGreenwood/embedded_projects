# embedded_projects

# Description
Projects primarily using an arduino uno as a programmer (using the arduino ide provided isp sketch) interfaced with an arduino mega (atmega2560).

Trying to use no arduino provided functions or other helpers.


# Projects
make_led_blink: Simple program to make an led blink



# CMake
I set up a CMakeLists file to be used. It's not very interactive and just for my uses. I kinda want to write some python scripts to make it more in-depth and interactive for making the Makefile
