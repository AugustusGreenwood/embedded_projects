# embedded_projects

# Description
Projects primarily using an arduino uno as a programmer (using the arduino ide provided isp sketch) interfaced with an arduino mega (atmega2560).

Trying to use no arduino provided functions or other helpers.


# Projects
make_led_blink: Simple program to make an led blink



# CMake
I set up a CMakeLists file to be used. It's not very interactive and just for my uses. I kinda want to write some python scripts to make it more in-depth and interactive for making the Makefile



# TODO
Next project needs some more complex logic to play around with. ie get input and turn light on, get different turn off etc. Would also like to play with some sensors:
    water sensor
    motion sensor
    sound sensor
    Should be fun
Figure out why some of the weirdness with the register addresses in the datasheet
